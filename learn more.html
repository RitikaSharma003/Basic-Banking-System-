    In India, banks and banking have been divided into a number of groups. Each group has unique advantages and disadvantages when it comes to its operations. They each have a particular target market in mind. Some people work only in rural areas, while others work in both urban and rural areas. Most of them only provide service to major cities and towns.
    The banking sector is one of the most important financial foundations, and it is crucial to the health of the economy. A nation's trade, industrial, and agriculture finance needs must be addressed with greater dedication and care if it is to see economic growth. As a result, the growth of banking is intrinsically linked to a nation's development. Banks nowadays should not be seen as money dealers but as leaders in development. They are essential in the mobilisation of deposits and the distribution of credit to numerous economic sectors.
  </p>

 <h2> The features of the Indian banking system:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li style="list-style: disc ;">            
<h4 style="margin-top:4px;margin-bottom:3px;">Deals with Money</h4>
<p style="font-size:19px;">
The primary function of a bank is to manage all financial transactions. You can safely save your money in a bank account, for instance, and you will be interested in the money you accumulate there.
</p>
</li>

<li style="list-style: disc; margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:3px;">
<h4>Provides Loans</h4>
<p style="font-size:19px;">
By offering loans for a range of goods, banks make more money. The bank obtains the additional funds by making fixed-rate loans to the qualified borrower.
Nowadays, banks offer loans for a range of objectives, such as student loans, car loans, mortgage loans, personal loans, and so forth.>
</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style: disc; margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:3px;">

<h4>Withdrawal and payment facilities</h4>
<p style="font-size:19px;">
Customers can swiftly and conveniently get their money using the several payment and withdrawal services offered by banks. Customers can withdraw cash using checks and draughts in addition to ATMs set up by banks at various locations throughout the city.</p>

</li>
<li style="list-style: disc;margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:3px;">

<h4>Internet services</h4>
<p style="font-size:19px;">
Another component of a bank is the internet services that are now offered by modern banks. Customers now find it much simpler to complete multiple transactions thanks to the development of the internet and its integration into the banking sector. Banks are offering online services via their apps. Without having cash on you, you can pay your bills, shop, and purchase groceries.</p>
</li>

<li style="list-style: disc; margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:3px;">

<h4>Business</h4>
<p style="font-size:19px;">
The provision of banking services to customers is not the only objective of banking. All banks have subsidiary businesses they are involved in to generate additional revenue. Their sole duty is to provide the highest levels of customer service and interest rates in an effort to draw in more customers. Money is transferred from one hand to the next in order to profit.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <h2>How Banks and Bank Industry Work</h2>
    
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
     
    </blockquote>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Banks control the movement of money between individuals and businesses, whether they are physical institutions or internet ones. More specifically, banks provide deposit accounts, which are safe storage spaces for people's cash. Banks lend to other people or companies using the funds in deposit accounts.</p>

        <p style="font-size:20px">In exchange, borrowers pay interest on those loans to the bank. The initial deposit account holder then receives a portion of that interest back in the form of interest, typically on a savings account, money market account, or certificate of deposit (CD) account. The main sources of income for banks are the interest on loans and the fees they charge their clients.</p>
        <p style="font-size:20px;">These charges could be connected to particular items like bank accounts or financial services. An investment bank that manages investor portfolios, for instance, may charge a fee for that service. Alternatively, a bank may charge an origination fee to a homebuyer who receives a mortgage loan.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
          The banking industry is very tightly regulated. The Federal Reserve System regulates banks and other financial institutions and works with state regulatory organisations to make sure banks abide by the law. Other federal organisations, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), are also responsible for overseeing banks.</p>
